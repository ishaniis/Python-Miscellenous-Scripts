All the Implementations:

BFS
DFS
A*
Bidirectional
IDFS (Not working though)  (Needs De-bugging)

The input format has been explained in the code itself. 

For Bi-directional, the input is a little different. As of now, the code is not working with maze in list or tuple.It's only working
for dictionary data types.

Q4_fullproof_implementation_DFS.py - Works perfectly for evn 100 X 100 maze
The solution for the same has been generated and the GIF attached is the solution for the same. The full proof implementation works on DFS 
search algorithm. 

All the outputs generated have been duly attached in the Main PDF document.

For DFS_implementation.py file, the maze on which it works is also attached. In this implementation, the source and destination has 
been specified using @ and $. 

Rest, For all the codes, the inputs can be modulated. 

Astar implementation can not be categorized as full proof, as it still needs improvement in terms of making the code for generic robust 
implementation.
